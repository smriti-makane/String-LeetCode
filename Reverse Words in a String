151. Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space. Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"

Example 3:
Input: s = "a good example"
Output: "example good a"

class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversed.append(words[i]);
            if (i != 0) {
                reversed.append(" ");
            }
        }
        
        return reversed.toString();
    }
}
